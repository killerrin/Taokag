The Adventures of Killerrin and Gammahok. This is an RPG I made as a child with a friend within RPG Maker VX. Expect plenty of spelling and grammatical errors, massive maps that lead to nowhere, nonsensical quest lines and just in general childish overtones. 

Despite this, RPG Maker VX's Scripting system was my first forray into programming so it holds a special place in my heart
